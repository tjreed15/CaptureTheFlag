TODO:
1. Change client waiting to add start button (not just space button)
2. Change client display if player has flag or is in jail
3. Allow client to 'scroll' the view when the world is larger than the screen


Future Improvements:
1. Allow multiple games at once
2. Allow Users to choose abilities
	- Speed, visibility, size, turns_in_jail, endurance (when sprint is added), defense
3. Timeout players from tagging (allow 1 tag every x seconds)
4. Timeout players from flag guarding (allow in area near flag every x seconds)
5. Allow players a short time to sprint
6. Allow the game to be played back (replay the game at faster speed)


Far future:
1. Allow users to log in
2. Allow users to reconnect to a game (as per their log in info)
3. Keep track of wins/losses (per team and per user)
4. Make terrain (mountains, walls, water)


Look into:
1. Move to different framework
	- Node.js
	- WSGI
