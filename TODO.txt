TODO:
0.5. Fix flag (inscribed circle -> inscribed rect)
1. Change client waiting to add start button (not just space button)
2. Change client display if player has flag or is in jail


Future Improvements:
1. Allow multiple games at once
2. Allow Users to choose abilities
	- Speed, visibility, size, turns_in_jail, endurance (when sprint is added), defense
3. Timeout players from tagging (allow 1 tag every x seconds)
4. Timeout players from flag guarding (allow in area near flag every x seconds)
5. Allow players a short time to sprint
6. Allow the game to be played back (replay the game at faster speed)


Far future:
1. Allow users to log in
2. Allow users to reconnect to a game (as per their log in info)
3. Keep track of wins/losses (per team and per user)
4. Make terrain (mountains, walls, water)


Look into:
1. Move to different framework
	- Node.js
	- WSGI
