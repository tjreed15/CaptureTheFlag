This repository contains code for users to play the game of capture the flag. 

To do so, follow these steps:
	1. Run the server on a remote machine as follows:
		- python ./server/server.py (port)
	2. Run as many client instances as desired on seperate machines to connect to the game server:
		- python ./client/client.py (host-ip) (port)
	3. In order to start the game, the first client to connect must send the server the 'start' command
		- In the current build, this is done by pressing the space bar
	4. Move your player around the board according to the rules described below:
		- Movement is done via the arrow keys


Rules:
	1. Each team starts on their own side of the playing field.
	2. The goal of the game is to cross into the other team's side, 
		steal the flag, and return it to their own side.
	3. If at any point a player is tagged while on the opposing team's side,
		that player will go to jail for a set period of time.
	4. Upon being released from jail, the player returns to their own side
		of the field and resumes play as normal.
	5. Gameplay continues until a player from either team wins the game by
		successfully crossing the midway line while in possession of the 
		opponent's flag.
